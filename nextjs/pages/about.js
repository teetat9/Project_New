      <p>
        This site was scaffolded from Figma materials you provided and translated into a
        clean, modern Next.js + Tailwind CSS codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can evolve the components and pages to match your exact Figma visuals by
        tweaking copy, spacing, and colors.
